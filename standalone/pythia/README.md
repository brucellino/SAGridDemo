This is the PYTHIA demo.

The aim of the demonstration is to run a large Monte-Carlo simulation of particle physics collisions in order to reproduce some interesting
plots in the field. 


Problem statement

Required packages

We are going to be simulating pure physics with PYTHIA, with no detector equipment. However, we would like to be able to store the output 
in ROOT files (see http://root.cern.ch for more). Therefore, we need to distributed the ROOT headers and libraries for Pythia to be 
compiled against in order for ROOT files to be written.
