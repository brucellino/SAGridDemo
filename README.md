This is the README for the SAGrid DEMOS directory.

This repository has been pulled from the private SAGrid SVN repo, containing several demos for shwoing the potential of the
South African National Grid (SAGrid). These are found in subdirectories with their own READMES.

Demos are under constant development, although working demos will be tagged as such.
